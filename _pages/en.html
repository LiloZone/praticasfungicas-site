encontroTitulo: OUR MEETINGS
encontroConteudo: Microbiology for artists started as a study group at BioLiloLab with 6 meetings from april to may, 2019.

conclusaoTitulo: WAS IT WORTH IT?
conclusaoItem1: In an investigation to make the invisible visible, we prepared culture media for bacteria and fungi and harvested microorganisms from ordinary environments, such as the subway and even the mouth.
conclusaoItem2: We made use of the space's infrastructure and employed digital fabrication, engraving culture media in the laser cutter in order to provide the colonies a personalized mold they could grow onto.
conclusaoItem3: In the last meeting we received the visit of Jana√≠na Dernowsek and Alessandro Queiroz, from BioEdTech, who presented their 3D bioprinter. We are planning ways of printing agar culture media in 3D.
